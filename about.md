I'm Antoine Boellinger, a software engineer and animation enthusiast.

In this blog I share some of my thoughts and experiences on programming for the entertainment industry.


### More Information

I have always been interested in many things, and having trouble about making choices.
That is why, as a teenager, I decided I would work in animation: the meeting point of screenwriting, drawing, acting and technique...
Having a taste fot maths, I chose then technical angle, and started to study computer science.

I graduated in from *Ecole Polytechnique* and *Paris 8 (ATI)* in 2013.
Since, I have worked in the animation industry at different positions:
R&D developer, CG supervisor, assistant head of studio, and currently, CTO for *Studio Hari*.
